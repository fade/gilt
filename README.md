This creates a `gilt` executable you can run directly:

```bash
./gilt
```

### Install System-Wide

```bash
sudo make install
```

Then run from anywhere:

```bash
gilt
```

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to a Git repository
2. Run `./gilt` (or `gilt` if installed)
3. Use `j`/`k` to navigate, `Tab` to switch panels
4. Press `Space` to stage files, `c` to commit
5. Press `q` to quit
